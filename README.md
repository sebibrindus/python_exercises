A repository for the exercises I did while learning Python while wwatching the videos of [Python Programming Masterclass from Tim Buchalka (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/learn/lecture/17745272#overview)

# Exercises:

 **1. Guess the Number game - [guess_the_number.py](https://github.com/sebibrindus/python_exercises/blob/python_exercises/guess_the_number.py)**
 A very basic game made using Python that requires the user to guess a number between 1 and another number the user enters from keyboard.
 The user is required to enter the number from the keyboard. 
If the number entered is too low, the game will print a corresponding message. Likewise for the case the number is too high.
User has a predetermined 5 tries before the game is considered lost. If the users inputs 0, the game exits.
