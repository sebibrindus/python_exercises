A repository for the exercises I did while learning Python while watching the videos of [Python Programming Masterclass from Tim Buchalka (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/learn/lecture/17745272#overview)

# Exercises:

 **1. Guess the Number game - [guess_the_number.py](https://github.com/sebibrindus/python_exercises/blob/python_exercises/guess_the_number.py)**
 A very basic game made using Python that requires the user to guess a number between 1 and another number the user enters from keyboard.
 The user is required to enter the number from the keyboard. 
If the number entered is too low, the game will print a corresponding message. Likewise for the case the number is too high.
User has a predetermined 5 tries before the game is considered lost. If the users inputs 0, the game exits. // Added function that checks for valid input (must input integer)

**2. Palindrome checker - [palindrome_functions.py](https://github.com/sebibrindus/python_exercises/blob/python_exercises/palindrome_functions.py)**
A script that can chekc if a string the user entered from the keyboard is a palindrome (same characters read from the beggining or from the eng).
Works with either single words or sentences. The app verifies if the string is a single word or a sentence, and applies a different function accordingly. In the case of a sentence, the app removes the spaces in the string and applies the palindrome function as like for any other word. Is built using functions in python.
